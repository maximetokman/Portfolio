                <h1>Predicting Coronavirus Deaths</h1>
                <p>
                    As the Covid-19 pandemic tests the world, the US has tragically 
                    faced over 100,000 deaths. Many states were more or less under 
                    control, and some states were unfortunately more prone to the 
                    disease. In this project, I used data containing the number of deaths 
                    and individuals tested in every state in the country to create 
                    various models that help relate the population and population density 
                    of a state to the number of tested individuals expected for that 
                    state and the death level expected based on that data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used polynomial regressions to predict the number of individuals 
                    tested given a population or population density, and k-nearest neighbors 
                    to estimate the expected death level based on death data from states 
                    with similar population and testing amounts. Please see the attached 
                    paper with a detailed report of my approach and findings. You can find 
                    my Github repository for this project <a href="https://github.com/maximetokman/CS-349-Final" target="_blank">here</a>.
