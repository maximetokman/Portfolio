                    I utilized python's PyTorch library to create an image recognition 
                    algorithm that classifies pictures of dogs according to 10 different breeds. 
                    I built both a convolutional and a fully connected network. 
                    For the fully connected network, I used 2 hidden layers and 4 total layers. The 
                    convolutional network also had 4 total layers with 2 hidden layers. I then 
                    trained the models on the training partition of 'DogSet', a data set of 
                    roughly 10,000 dog pictures and their corresponding breed. For the convolutional 
                    network, I used a kernel size of (5, 5) and stride (1, 1). I used a kernel size of 2 
                    for the pooling step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After training both a fully connected and convolutional neural network, I compared 
                    their accuracies and found that the convolutional network resulted in about a 45% 
                    accuracy as opposed to the fully connected network, which had an accuracy of about 
                    35%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During training, the algorithm also computed the accuracy on the training and 
                    validation partitions of the data set over every epoch (a full iteration of the data 
                    set). Below are the graphs of accuracy over each epoch for both models. As we can see, 
                    training accuracy remained higher than validation accuracy, with both increasing.
