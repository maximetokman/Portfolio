                    I created a command-line tool that creates a Spotify playlist combining songs from multiple 
                    playlists in a user's Spotify account. Currently, it does not appear that Spotify has 
                    the capability to combine playlists without the user manually copying individual songs 
                    to another playlist. For large playlists, this isn't feasible, so this tool allows the 
                    user to input the names of the playlists that should be combined, and a new playlist 
                    is created with all of the songs in the playlists selected.
