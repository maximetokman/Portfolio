                    I am a third-year student at Northwestern 
                    University studying computer science. In addition to this, I am 
                    pursuing a minor in data science and a certificate in managerial 
                    analytics from the Kellogg School of Management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience in various languages including C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript, 
                    as well as frameworks like React and React Native for front end development and 
                    AWS back-end services. My interests include machine learning, full stack development of 
                    websites and mobile apps, and network programming. On this website you will be able to 
                    find some of my recent machine learning work as well as some other projects I came up with.

                    At Northwestern, in addition to my coursework, I am actively involved 
                    in my fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon, serving as Vice President of Finance. 
                    I also compete on the club tennis team. Finally, I enjoy photography 
                    as a hobby as well. Below you can find some of my photos taken over 
                    the years. I am originally from San Diego, CA, where I continue to spend 
                    much of my time when I'm not on campus.
