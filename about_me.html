                <p>
                    I am a second-year student at Northwestern 
                    University studying computer science. In addition to this I am 
                    pursuing a minor in data science and a certificate in managerial 
                    analytics from the Kellogg School of Management.

                    I have experience in various languages including C, C++, C#, and Python, and 
                    have worked on cool projects in the past, including developing geographic 
                    information systems and numerous machine learning models. During my summer of 
                    2019 I had the opportunity to work for Beghou Consulting in Chicago 
                    to help develop software used for firm operations. I have significant 
                    coursework in various areas of computer science, with my interests more heavily 
                    oriented toward algorithms and machine learning. I look forward to continuing my 
                    understanding of the evolving nature of maching learning as computer science 
                    becomes so heavily engaged with big data.

                    At Northwestern, in addition to my coursework, I am actively involved 
                    in my fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon, serving as Vice President of Finance. 
                    I also compete on the club tennis team, for which our Nationals trip 
                    this spring was thwarted by the pandemic. Finally, I enjoy photography 
                    as a hobby as well. Below you can find some of my photos taken over 
                    the years. I am originally from San Diego, CA, where I continue to spend 
                    much of my time when not on campus.
